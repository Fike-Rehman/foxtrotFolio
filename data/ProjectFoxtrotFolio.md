This portfolio website (that you are visiting right now), is a solo project that I developed to showcase my skills, experience, and the overall trajectory of my career. This is an open-source project hosted on **GitHub Pages**, with the complete source code available in a public repository on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/Fike-Rehman/foxtrotfolio).

The website is built using the **React** JavaScript library and powered by **Vite.js** for a modern development workflow. Styling is implemented using **CSS**, adhering to responsive design principles to ensure the content adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.

In addition to highlighting my skills and projects, this site offers a comprehensive snapshot of the path my career has taken. I will continue adding details of the technical projects I am working on, making this site a dynamic and evolving showcase of my expertise. You are encouraged to visit regularly, as updates will be made periodically to reflect my latest work and accomplishments.
